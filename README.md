# 🧠 Density Functional Theory (DFT) in Python

Welcome to the **DFT-using-Python** repository — a beginner-friendly, step-by-step implementation of **Density Functional Theory (DFT)** using **Python and NumPy**. This project is designed to bridge the gap between **quantum mechanics** and **numerical computation**, making DFT accessible to students, researchers, and curious developers.

## 📌 What is DFT?

**Density Functional Theory (DFT)** is a quantum mechanical method used to investigate the electronic structure of many-body systems, such as atoms, molecules, and solids. DFT reduces the complexity of solving the many-electron Schrödinger equation by using **electron density** as the central variable.
